Kaboom Serializer
=================

A versatile message serializer/deserializer for REST APIs. Kaboom supports multiple media types and structural variants without DTOs, using a canonical data model.  The object graph follows the canonical data model, while the serializer/deserializer uses a "resource data model," formally derived from the canonical model, to define the representation.

Kaboom is the only serializer that shoots messages out of a canon!
