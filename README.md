Kaboom
======

A versatile message serializer/deserializer for REST APIs. Kaboom supports multiple media types and structural variants without DTOs, using a canonical data model.  The object graph follows the canonical data model, while the serializer/deserializer uses a "resource data model," formally derived from the canonical model, to define the representation.

Why the name "Kaboom?"
Canonical Serializer
Sounds like "Cannon Cereal"
Thus, [Kaboom](http://goo.gl/R1WcT8).
